Before you can have this talk through your Alexa device you need to create an Alexa routine.
The routine needs to end with the VoiceMonkey skill and be triggered by the monkey (doorbell) that is created by the voicemonkey skill.
Also you need to disable the doorbell announcement in the routine and/or skill.
Otherwise it will say "Someone is at the -monkey name- door" before the anouncement.
